This project showcases my experience with AWS event-driven architecture using AWS EventBridge, AWS Lambda, and S3 web pages. The goal is to demonstrate how these technologies can be used to create a scalable and efficient event-driven system for managing beekeeping operations.

## Features
- Event-driven architecture using AWS EventBridge
- Serverless functions with AWS Lambda
- Static web pages hosted on S3
- Real-time event processing and notifications
- Scalable and cost-effective solution

## Technologies Used
- AWS EventBridge
- AWS Lambda
- S3
